## Why it's awesome?

* Basis isn't about a UI framework. Basis provides only basic frame of components. So you build a responsive web page quickly and easy to overwrite with your Sass or CSS.
* CSS architecture of Basis is [FLOCSS](https://github.com/hiloki/flocss). So it is possible a modular approach.
* Basis has incorporated the concept of vertical rhythm. So you can be a good-balanced design.
* Basis has many mixins. Usufule mixins and abstract mixin of compornents.
